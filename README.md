# [Project 1: Sentiment Analysis of Financial News using NLTK](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/Seoul-bike-prediction.git)
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on financial news articles using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. The goal is to classify the sentiment of news articles as positive, negative, or neutral based on the textual content.

# [Project 2: Seoul Bike Rental Demand Prediction](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/Seoul-bike-prediction.git)
The project utilizes a dataset of historical bike rental records to train and evaluate machine learning models for demand prediction. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Seoul Bike Sharing System. The dataset consists of 24 coulmns and 1048576 rows. It includes information such as date, time, weather conditions, and the number of bikes rented.

# [Project 3: Chronic_Kidney_Disease](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/Chronic_Kidney_Disease.git)
The machine learning project that aims to classify instances of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The project utilizes a dataset of patient health attributes to train and evaluate various classification models. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of instances representing patient records with 24 attributes. These attributes include patient demographic information, symptoms, and laboratory test results. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of Chronic Kidney Disease.

# [Project 4: Email Spam Classifier](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/Email-Spam-Classifier.git)
The project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content and characteristics. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the spam_detection. It includes a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset consists of 4602 rows and 58 columns

# [Project 1: Exploring-the-NYC-Airbnb-Market](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/DA_Exploring-the-NYC-Airbnb-Market)

In this project, I have applied <b> Data Importing and Cleaning skills </b> to uncover below insights about the Airbnb market in New York City.

*What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
How many adverts are for private rooms?
How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?

# [Project 2: A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/A-Visual-history-of-Nobel-prize-winners)

The goal is to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners using <b> Data Manipulation and visualization skills </b>, and answering key questions

*Which country got the most Nobel prizes
What is the gender of a typical Nobel Prize winner? 3.The first woman to win the Nobel Prize
How old are you when you get the prize?
Age differences between prize categories

# [Project 3: Exploring the History of LEGO](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/Exploring-the-Evolution-of-Lego-.git)

In this project, we are going to explore a key development in the history of Lego: the introduction of licensed sets such as Star Wars, Super Heroes, and Harry Potter and going to findout answers for below questions.

What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?
In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)?
