# [Project 1: Seoul Bike Rental Demand Prediction](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/Seoul-bike-prediction.git)
The project utilizes a dataset of historical bike rental records to train and evaluate machine learning models for demand prediction. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Seoul Bike Sharing System. It includes information such as date, time, weather conditions, and the number of bikes rented. The dataset consists of 24 coulmns and 1048576 rows.

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project that aims to classify instances of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The project utilizes a dataset of patient health attributes to train and evaluate various classification models.

# [Project 3: Email Spam Classifier](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/Email-Spam-Classifier.git)
This repository contains code and resources for an email spam classifier. The project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content and characteristics.



# [Project 1: Exploring-the-NYC-Airbnb-Market](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/DA_Exploring-the-NYC-Airbnb-Market)

In this project, I have applied <b> Data Importing and Cleaning skills </b> to uncover below insights about the Airbnb market in New York City.

*What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
How many adverts are for private rooms?
How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?

# [Project 2: A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/A-Visual-history-of-Nobel-prize-winners)

The goal is to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners using <b> Data Manipulation and visualization skills </b>, and answering key questions

*Which country got the most Nobel prizes
What is the gender of a typical Nobel Prize winner? 3.The first woman to win the Nobel Prize
How old are you when you get the prize?
Age differences between prize categories

# [Project 3: Exploring the History of LEGO](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/Exploring-the-Evolution-of-Lego-.git)

In this project, we are going to explore a key development in the history of Lego: the introduction of licensed sets such as Star Wars, Super Heroes, and Harry Potter and going to findout answers for below questions.

What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?
In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)?
