# [Project 1: Exploring-the-NYC-Airbnb-Market](https://github.com/abhinavpeddi95/DA_Exploring-the-NYC-Airbnb-Market)

 The goal is to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:

*What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?

*How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?

*How many adverts are for private rooms?

*How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
